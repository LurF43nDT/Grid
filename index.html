                Its a game by FromSoftware that look and feels kinda like the Dark Souls series from the same studio, you still have all of your 
                totally over powered enemies/mobs thats a standard in these type of games. But what makes this game different from the other 
                games that uses this type of design in gameplay is that your character doesnt feel as stiff when moving around or in combat,
                it feels much more smooth and organic as you would expect. And with all the OP enemies/mobs you meet there really isnt a way 
                to just powerhouse your way through them. Depending on your weapon of choice your playstyle is going to change based of your
                weapon. In BloodBorne they use what is called Trick Weapons, meele based weapons that transforms in various ways. They
                can either start off as short range sword style weapon or transform into a mid range whip weapon or as you see in the picture
                to the right my favourite weapon called the KIRKHAMMER, by default it is a big slow but powerfull hammer or you can detach the
                big square stone at the end and you have a smaller one handed sword that allows you to go into of a more lighweight attack style
